 * 
 * File I/O in TypeScript is "asynchronous", meaning that we can't just
 * read the file and return its contents. You'll learn more about this 
 * in class. For now, just leave the "async" and "await" where they are. 
 * You shouldn't need to alter them.
 * 
 * @param path The path to the file being loaded.
 * @returns a "promise" to produce a 2-d array of cell values
